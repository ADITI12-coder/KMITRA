        "Biomedical Imaging Informatics(Digital Biomedical Images) Digital Medical imaging is one of the fastest-moving areas of discovery, offering radiologists, pathologists, ophthalmologists, and practitioners in other image-rich disciplines the opportunity to augment their workflows with algorithms that are getting better every day. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular, when the data sets are large and complex\nBioinformatics has been used for in-silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly applied throughout the development cycle of advanced tactical missiles. This increased reliance on CFD is due, in part, to the increased demands being made on the missiles for higher speed, greater manoeuvrability, multiple missions, and the maturity of the CFD discipline. The Internet of Things has already started playing an important role in our daily lives. The number of IoT interconnected devices such as sensors for weather mapping, agriculture, security, and industrial commercial and defence applications is more than 50 billion. Robotics is an allied domain and has given birth to another domain called Internet of Robotic Things.\n\nTable Data:",

        "The establishment of the Student Council plays an integral and important role in the student community. Student Council provide a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the college and the wider community. Students have a voice and a contribution to make to their college. It is important that they be given the opportunity to express their views on issues of concern to them in the college. It is equally important that they are listened to and encouraged to take an active part in promoting the aims and objectives of the college. The Student Council will set its own objectives. Some general objectives could include: To enhance communication between students, management and staff. To promote an environment conducive to educational and personal development. To promote friendship and respect among pupils. To support the management and staff in the development of the college. To represent the views of the students on matters of general concern to them.\n\nTable Data:\n\nTable 1:\n| S.No | Name Of The Student | Roll Number | Designation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | RAJYA LAHARI CHODAVARUPU | 20BD1A052B | PRESIDENT |\n| 2 | YUKTAA SRI ADDANKI | 20BD1A053V | VICE PRESIDENT |\n| 3 | VAISHNAVI KROVVIDI | 21BD1A053X | MEMBER AND HEAD OF PR |\n| 4 | FARHAN | 21BD1A661Q | MEMBER AND SIC OF PR |\n| 5 | AAKASH BANDA | 21BD1A660E | MEMBER OF PR |\n| 6 | ANKUR BANERJEE | 21BD1A6608 | MEMBER OF PR |\n| 7 | ANANYA PERWALA | 21BD1A0504 | MEMBER OF PR |\n| 8 | ANVITA | 21BD1A058B | MEMBER AND HEAD OF OC |\n| 9 | AFIFA | 21BD1A0583 | MEMBER AND SIC OF OC |\n| 10 | ATHARVA | 21BD1A056A | MEMBER OF OC |\n| 11 | ESHAAN | 21BD1A664E | MEMBER OF OC |\n| 12 | PREET | 21BD1A051G | MEMBER OF OC |\n| 13 | SHUCHENDRA | 21BD1A6757 | MEMBER OF OC |\n| 14 | RASHIQUA | 21BD1A661L | MEMBER OF OC |\n| 15 | AGAMAMIDI SANJAY, | 21BD1A0503 | KMITRA REPRESENTATIVES |\n| 16 | NAMEERA FATIMA | 21BD1A0516 | KMITRA REPRESENTATIVES |\n| 17 | AKHIL KUMAR | 21BD1A053F | AALAP CLUBHEADS |\n| 18 | SHIV , KAUSTUBH | 20BD1A058H | AALAP CLUBHEADS |\n| 19 | TANMAYIE P , | 21BD1A053H | MUDRA CLUBHEADS |\n| 20 | SPOORTHY | 20BD1A66B1 | MUDRA CLUBHEADS |\n| 21 | HARIKA KOLLI | 21BD1A662W | ABHINAYA CLUBHEADS |\n| 22 | KARTIKEYA | 21BD1A6716 | ABHINAYA CLUBHEADS |\n| 23 | SIDDARTH, | 20BD1A6604 | KREEDA CLUBHEADS |\n| 24 | SNEHA | 21BD1A663W | KREEDA CLUBHEADS |\n| 25 | URUJ, | 21BD1A051T | RECURSE CLUBHEADS |\n| 26 | SRIKAR | 22BD1A1259 | RECURSE CLUBHEADS |\n| 27 | SAILIKITH PENDYALA, | 21BD1A05BJ | TOL CLUBHEADS |\n| 28 | T.

        "Tessellator is KMIT’s learning management system. It is customized version of \n  Moodle, an open source learning management system \n  provided by Google. We at KMIT have customized it as per our needs and have been using \n  it on multiple networks. It provides an option of 2 different modules. \n  After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a \n  collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, \n  they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write \n  code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. \n  There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. \n  If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. \n  The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform Moodle by itself doesn’t \n  have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to \n  suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other \n  programming languages.\n\nTable Data:",

        "The college management strongly believes that sports play an important role in a student's growth and development. \r\n\tNot only do they help in improve mental health and physical fitness of the body but also hone personality skills by inculcating leadership abilities, teamwork, non-verbal communication, confidence, coping with setbacks, conflict management, and discipline to name a few. A badminton court matching professional standards has been built behind Block B for the use of Faculty members, Staff and Students. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The Faculty members and Staff at KMIT are particularly passionate about this sport and annual competitions are held for them regularly. Coaching is given to all the students in the college campus from 4-5.30 pm everyday .The training is open to students of all years. Furthermore, the college has formed a Yoga team which, under the guidance of their guru, performed on invitation at various events outside the campus. Equal importance is given to games requiring brain skill at KMIT. Rooms above the auditorium have specially been allocated for chess, caroms, and table tennis. These rooms also house all the other sports equipment. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJust as is the case with outdoor games, intra-college tournaments are held for these games as well.

It is a customized version of MOODLE, an open source learning management system provided by Google. We, at KMIT, have customized it as per our needs and have been using it on multiple networks. It provides an option of two different modules. After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform MOODLE by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other programming languages.\n\nTable Data:\n\nTable 1:\n| S.No | Faculty Name |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Dr S Rajasekaran (Principal Investigator) |\n| 2 | Dr Rohit Tapadia |\n| 3 | Dr. R.Devika Rubi |\n| 3 | Prof. Vinay Patankar |\n\n\nTable 2:\n| S.No | Roll No. | Student Name |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 17BD1A050T | Mr. Kanneganti Sai Rohith |\n| 2 | 17BD1A051A | Mr. Pingali Raghavendra Suraj |\n| 3 | 17BD1A051E | Mr. Priyal Jain |\n| 4 | 17BD1A057Q | Ms. Swathi Gupta |\n| 5 | 17BD1A050U | Mr. Kasavaraju Abhay Krishna |\n| 6 | 17BD1A050Q | Mr. Kala Samyak Jain |\n| 7 | 17BD1A051N | Ms. Sri Laxmi Sai Sahithi Dendukuru |\n| 8 | 17BD1A0432 | Mr. Kota Ruchik |\n| 9 | 18BD1A0561 | Mr. A Sai Vijaya Bhargavi |\n| 10 | 18BD1A050P | Mr. Kathoroju Harsha Vardhan |\n| 11 | 18BD1A051A | Mr. Telukunta Vijay Abhinav |\n| 12 | 18BD1A055E | Mr. Srinivas Yadav |\n| 13 | 18BD1A051N | Mr. Vivek Rupender Gopu |\n| 14 | 18BD1A051W | Mr. Yerramallu M S S Krishna Deep |\n\n\nTable 3:\n| S.No | Project Title | Type | Funding Agency | Amount | Duration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Detection and Classification of Weld  defects from X-Ray Images Using Machined/Deep Learning | Sponsored Research | Defence Research and Development Laboratory | ₹ 14,98,600 | 12Months (ongoing) |\n\n\nTable 4:\n| S.No | Project Title | Type | Funding Agency | Amount | Duration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | A Mutli-GPU Implementation of Cerans Solver | Sponsored Research | Defence Research and Development Laboratory | ₹ 19,99,000 | 2 years (ongoing) |\n| 2 | Software tool to perform Detailed Subsystems Level Checks and to report information about Aerospace vehicle health | Sponsored Research | DRDO - Hyd | ₹ 9.75 Lacs | Ongoing |\n| 3 | Computer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20) | Sponsored Research | BIRAC | ₹ 15 Lacs | Ongoing |\n\n\nTable 5:\n| S.No | Project Title | Type | Funding Agency | Amount | Duration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | A Mutli-GPU Implementation of Cerans Solver | Sponsored Research | Defence Research and Development Laboratory | ₹ 19,99,000 | 2 years (ongoing) |\n| 2 | Computer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20) | Sponsored Research | BIRAC | ₹15L | Ongoing |\n\n\nTable 6:\n| S.No | Project Title | Funding Agency | Type | Year | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Object Detection and Tracking (ODT) in Infrared Images with Application to Guidance and Control | Sponsored Research | ADVAITA CARS | 6 months | 985000 |\n| 2 | Computer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20) | Sponsored Research | BIRAC | Ongoing | ₹15L |\n| 3 | Face detection door lock system using raspberry p | Research | Self Funded | Ongoing | NA |\n| 4 | Automated face mask detection & temperature alert system | Research | Self Funded | Ongoing | NA |\n| 5 | Drone for Defense Application | Research | Self Funded | Ongoing | NA |\n\n\nTable 7:\n| S.No | Project Title | Funding Agency | Type | Year | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | CAD4MBC with customization | Yashoda Hospitals/Indo American | Research | Ongoing | ₹15L |\n| 2 | Defining new crypto protocols for signal processing to be used in SDR applications for missile Design | DRDL | Research | 2020 | Self Funded |\n| 3 | CERANS Solver from CPU to GPU | KMIT | Research | completed | Self Funded |\n\n\nTable 8:\n| S.No | Project Title | Funding Agency | Type | Year | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Spider Robot | KMIT | Research | Ongoing | Self Funded |\n| 2 | Walking robot | KMIT | Research | Ongoing | Self Funded |\n| 3 | CADC | BIRAC | Sponsored Project | 2019 | ₹50L |\n| 4 | Virtual Police Station | SIH | Innovation/EDC | 2019 | NA |\n| 5 | Kisaan portal | Kisan Forum Pvt Limited - SIH | Innovation / EDC | 2019 | ₹1L |\n| 6 | Spider Robo | KMIT | Research | 2019 | Self Funded |\n| 7 | Doshi Anveshan Yantra | KMIT | Research | 2019 | Self Funded |\n\n\nTable 9:\n| S.No | Project Title | Funding Agency | Type | Year | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abhimanyu Humanoid | KMIT | Research | 2018 | Self Funded |\n| 2 | Smart And Friendly Irrigation System Using IOT | Teleparadigm | Research | 2018 | ₹30,000 |\n| 3 | Control Systems Lab | KMIT | Research | 2018 | Self Funded |\n\n\nTable 10:\n| S.No | Project Title | Funding Agency | Type | Year | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | EDC Lab | KMIT | Research | 2016 | Self Funded |",

        "•\tSmart Classrooms\r\n                    Equipped with projectors, screens, and interactive boards, smart classrooms allow faculty to present dynamic multimedia content like videos, animations, and live coding demonstrations, making learning more engaging. •\tLearning Management Systems (LMS)\r\n                    KMIT uses platforms like Tesseract, KMIT vista YouTube channel, Tessellator, kmitonline.com, Tantrik, Toofan, Prashnmanch or other LMS tools to share resources, track assignments, and engage students in discussions. •\tCase Studies\r\n                      Real-world examples and case studies are often used to relate theoretical knowledge to practical applications, enabling students to understand the relevance of what they are learning •\tProblem-Based Learning (PBL): \r\n                      Students are presented with a problem and asked to find solutions collaboratively, enhancing their problem-solving and teamwork abilities. In a flipped classroom, students review learning materials (such as lecture videos or readings) outside of class and then engage in hands-on activities, discussions, and projects during class time. This promotes better retention of concepts and encourages peer-to-peer learning. Digital tools like Tessellator, Telescope, Toofan, Prashnamanch quizzes can be used to conduct interactive quizzes during lessons, helping students to test their understanding in real-time and get instant feedback KMIT might collaborate with industry professionals, offering guest lectures, workshops, or live projects that allow students to interact with experts and gain insights into current industry trends and challenges Labs and practical sessions are emphasized in KMIT’s teaching approach. Students are encouraged to work on real projects, experiments, or simulations, particularly in fields like Computer Science •\tEnhanced Student Engagement: \r\n                        By actively involving students in the learning process, the classroom becomes a more dynamic and motivating environment •\tImproved Retention: \r\n                        Interactive learning methods have been shown to improve long-term retention and understanding of concepts •\tBetter Communication and Collaboration: \r\n                         Students learn to work in teams, improving their collaboration and communication skills—valuable assets in both academic and professional settings. Overall, interactive classroom teaching at KMIT aims to create an environment where students are not passive recipients of information but active participants in their learning journey. The Audio-Visual Centre at KMIT is dedicated to the creation and enhancement of audio and video content for educational purposes. It is equipped with advanced audio-visual technologies, making it an essential facility for creating professional-grade multimedia content. This facility is designed for both small-scale and large-scale production of e-content, from recording lectures to producing high-definition videos for online platforms. Key features of the Audio-Visual Centre: •\tHigh-definition video cameras and microphones\r\n                      •\tEditing software for audio and video content\r\n                      •\tStudio space for recording and production\r\n                      •\tTechnical support for troubleshooting and ensuring quality output\r\n                      •\tEquipment for live streaming and recording of events and lectures\n\nTable Data:",

        "The major goal of this course is to impart knowledge on techniques and theories related to data science which includes statistics, data mining, data warehousing and data visualization. KMIT offers a four-year under-graduate B.Tech course in Data Science. Data Science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths. As the world entered the era of big data, handling it was the main challenge and concern for the enterprise industries until 2010. Unlike data in the traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. A Data Scientist, according to Harvard Business Review, “is a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of Big Data”. Therefore it comes as no surprise that Data Scientists are coveted professionals in the Data Analytics and IT industry. With experts predicting that 40 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2020, Data Science career opportunities will only shoot through the roof! Shortage of skilled professionals in a world which is increasingly turning to data for decision making has also led to the huge demand for Data Scientists in start-ups as well as well-established companies. More than 50,000 jobs in the Data Science and Machine Learning are lying vacant in India, for lack of skilled professionals.

        "Plagiarism is the dishonest presentation of the work of others as if it were one’s own. Plagiarism violates the expectations of trust and honesty necessary for academic work in an ethical community, it is a serious offense. In addition, plagiarism undercuts the basic purposes of higher education by short-circuiting the processes of inquiry, reflection and communication that lead to learning. Using the exact words of another writer in part of a paper without both citation and quotation marks (or block indentation in the case of longer quotations) Cutting and pasting material from Internet or other electronic resources without proper citation of sources Including the paraphrased or summarized idea of another writer without acknowledging its source Accepting excessive assistance from another person in writing a paper without informing readers of the nature and extent of that collaboration Submitting for credit a complete paper or portion of a paper written by another person, no matter whether the paper was purchased, shared freely, stolen, found or acquired by other means Submitting music, drawings, paintings, sculptures or photographs that copy or rely closely on the work of other artists, without explicitly citing the original source Writing a computer program that is the same or closely similar to existing sources credit for a project, multimedia presentation, poster or other assignment that draws dishonestly on the work of others Duplicate submission is also a violation of academic integrity, because every assignment presumes that new inquiry and effort will produce new learning, and submitting a paper already written for another occasion subverts this learning. Submitting the same original paper for credit in more than one class in the same semester, without the expressed permission of both instructors involved, is not acceptable. Using the same paper or closely similar material from one semester to fulfill a requirement in another semester is normally not allowed without specific permission from the instructor. If students receive the same or similar assignments in different courses, they should consult with the professor about alternate assignments. Recognizing that students may sometimes commit plagiarism unintentionally because they do not know the conventions of quotation, citation and acknowledgement, professors may deal with cases of plagiarism in different ways. When in the professor’s judgment the student intends to do honest work but doesn't yet understand the conventions of academic quotation and acknowledgment, the professor may require the student to rewrite the paper, may lower the grade on the paper or may fail the paper. Cases of plagiarism that result in a failing grade for an assignment or for a course must be reported to the Provost in order to prevent any individual from plagiarizing repeatedly and each time professing ignorance. If a student plagiarizes repeatedly, the Provost may apply additional penalties, including dismissal from the college.\n\nTable Data:",
